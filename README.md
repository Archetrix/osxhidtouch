osxhidtouch
===========

(forked from astarasikov) User-space HID multitouch touchscreen driver for Mac OS X

Adapted to fit my laptop's hardware & resolution, and figured out/fixed bugs in dragging, etc. 

Multifinger tracking works, but it is probably not possible to add proper multifinger dragging without too much input lag
